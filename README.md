# Dart-Practice-Lessons

# Dart Basics and Practice Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Dart source files created for learning, practicing, and teaching core Dart programming concepts. Each file focuses on a single concept or a closely related group of concepts, making the repository suitable for structured learning and reference.

This repository is ideal for:
- Beginners learning Dart fundamentals
- Students in diploma or university programming courses
- Flutter learners strengthening their Dart foundation
- Trainers and instructors preparing teaching materials

All files are intentionally small, focused, and self-contained so that each concept can be understood independently.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized by concepts rather than full applications. Each `.dart` file demonstrates a specific language feature.

These operators return boolean values.

---

### Logical Operators
**File:** `logicOps.dart`

Explains logical operations used in conditions:
- AND (`&&`)
- OR (`||`)
- NOT (`!`)

---

### Bitwise Operators
**File:** `bitwiseOps.dart`

Covers bit-level operations including:
- AND (`&`)
- OR (`|`)
- XOR (`^`)
- NOT (`~`)
- Left shift (`<<`)
- Right shift (`>>`)

Useful for low-level and performance-sensitive programming.

---

### Ternary Operators
**Files:**
- `ternaryOperations.dart`
- `ternaryOperationsTask.dart`
- `ternarynulls.dart`

Demonstrates conditional expressions written in a compact form.

---

### Type Test Operators
**File:** `typetestOps.dart`

- `is`
- `is!`
- `as`

---

## Control Flow Statements

### Conditional Statements
**Files:**
- `conditionalIf.dart`
- `conditionsTasks.dart`

Demonstrates decision-making using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.

---

### Switch Statements
**Files:**
- `switchOps.dart`
- `switchCaseTask.dart`
- `switchCaseTask2.dart`

Used to execute different code blocks based on matching cases.

---

### Looping Constructs

#### For Loop
**Files:**
- `forloop.dart`
- `listLoop.dart`

Used for iterating a fixed number of times or over collections.

#### While Loop
**File:** `whileLoop.dart`

Executes code repeatedly while a condition remains true.

#### Do-While Loop
**File:** `dowhileloop.dart`

Executes the loop body at least once before checking the condition.

---

### Loop Control Keywords
**Files:**
- `breakStatement.dart`
- `continueStatement.dart`
- `looplabels.dart`

Used to control loop execution flow.

---

## Functions

Introduces function declaration, parameters, and return types.

---

### Return Values
**File:** `functionReturn.dart`

Demonstrates returning values from functions.

---

### Named Parameters
**File:** `namesParameters.dart`

Shows how named parameters improve readability and flexibility.

---

### Lambda (Arrow) Functions
**File:** `lambdaFunctions.dart`

Demonstrates concise one-line functions using arrow syntax.

---

### Recursion
**Files:**
- `functionRecursion.dart`
- `functionRecursion2.dart`

Illustrates functions that call themselves to solve problems.

---

## Collections

### Lists
**Files:**
- `lists.dart`
- `listGenerated.dart`

---

### Queue
**File:** `queue.dart`

Demonstrates FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure usage.

---

## Object-Oriented Programming

### Classes and Objects
**File:** `classPrac.dart`

Introduces class definitions, properties, and methods.

---

### Constructors
**File:** `classConstructors.dart`

Demonstrates default and parameterized constructors.

---

### Named Constructors
**Files:**
- `namedConstructors.dart`
- `taskNamedConstructors.dart`

Shows how named constructors allow multiple meaningful ways to create objects.

---

### Constructor Practice
**File:** `pracConstructors.dart`

Additional practice examples for constructor usage.

---

## Error Handling

### Try-Catch Blocks
**Files:**
- `trycatch.dart`
- `tryOnblock.dart`

Demonstrates handling runtime exceptions safely.

---

## Variables and Constants

### Variable Declaration
**File:** `var_us.dart`
